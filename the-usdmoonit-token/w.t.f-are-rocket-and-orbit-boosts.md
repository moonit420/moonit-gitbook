## Rocket Boosts - Holding Rewards

Rocket Boosts will serve as the holding rewards for our dear loyal astronauts on the Moonit platform. Token holders of $MOONIT can claim rewards called Rocket Boosts on our dApp at the end of every month.

* What are Rocket Boosts?
  * Bonuses coming from revenue from our trading platform and launching platform (40% after referrals).
* How can you claim?
  * You need to own at least 100 $MOONIT to be eligible for rewards. You can claim without paying for gas at the end of each month and are required to have accrued at least 0.2 eth worth of rewards at the end of the month in order to redeem anything!
  * Only tokens bought from the market and those that are unlocked are eligible to claiming such rewards (therefore KOL's, investors, and teams will not be able to participate in this).
* What are the rewards?
  * Rocket Boosts are calculated by the following equation:
  * $MOONIT Cashback = _Orbit Multiplier X_ \* **$ FEES PAID BY THE USER**
  * The multiplier X will range between 0.05 and 0.10 and is determined by the orbit cycle of the moon in real life! More details to come soon.
  * ex: If Ansem paid $100 in fees and it was a full moon on the actual day of claiming, Ansem would receive 0.1 \* 100 = 10 $MOONIT as a Rocket Bonus for the month!

Rocket boosts come from re[^1]venue from our trading platform and launching platform (40% after referrals) and we just want to give back to the community.

## Orbit Boosts - Staking Rewards

In the future, there will be a hub for users to stake their $MOONIT tokens and send them into orbit. Orbit Boosts lock up your tokens for an X amount of time and can only be released after a period of time. The primary purpose of Orbit Boosts is to allow users the chance to claim tokens that they missed while... let's say, they were sleeping! A novel concept to solve issues within entropy in the trading space, traders on Moonit will now be able to get a piece of the pie via Orbit Boosts.

How does this work? When a dev launches a token, they will be given the option to reserve a certain % of the supply for Orbit Boosts, receiving a 100% discount on their contract creation fee and sending some of their tokens to the Orbit Boost Vault. Then, users who have staked $MOONIT tokens have 24 hours from the time of a token launch to claim a % of reserved tokens. This is on a first come first serve basis.

Here are the offered periods of lock up and their respective rewards:

* 1 Week
  * Users can claim up to 3 tokens that week.
  * Minimum of 0.5 eth worth of $MOONIT tokens.
  * They receive 1% of the token
* 1 Month
  * Users can claim up to 15 tokens that month.
  * Minimum of 1 eth worth of $MOONIT tokens.
  * They receive 2% of the token
* 1 Year
  * Users can claim up to 400 $MOONIT tokens that year.
  * Minimum of 1.5 eth worth of $MOONIT tokens.
  * They receive 3% of the token
