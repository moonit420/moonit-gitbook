# Tokenomics

Our goal with tokenomics is to create a meticulous system that serves as infrastructure to reward stakeholders, investors, and traders in the long term and keep them on Base. At the end of the day, retention of traders on Base is the goal and $MOONIT will serve to achieve this.

This tokenomic system has been reviewed by token experts and created by team members who have worked with Starknet, Chainlink, and Arbitrum.
