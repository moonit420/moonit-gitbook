## Problem

With the rising success of [pump.fun](https://pump.fun/), we have reached a boiling point of clones launching acoss all the various chains. To name a few, we have [hold.fun](https://hold.fun/), [cannon.tech](https://cannon.tech/), [ape.store](https://ape.store/), [basejump.pro](https://basejump.pro/), [myparlay.com](https://www.myparlay.com/). While these mockups have brought in major great volume and attention with each launch, the saturation and overdoneness of these money farms soak up the degen perception of token launchers in the space.&#x20;

For Solana's case, this is a valid reaction from the market, as there isn't a need to overthrow the monopoly established by pumpdotfun and their major success.

For the case of other chains, the death of these token launching platforms can be viewed as detrimental, as many chains do indeed find a need for fair launching technology. Especially since Base and Ethereum are EVM based, the procedures and methods of rugging increase tenfold. Where as Solana devs can only jeet and snipe, EVM ERC20 teams can honeypot, re-enter as an attack, and obfuscate malicious attacks via proxies.

## Solution

We understand these issues above and have come up with a grand solution to unify the benefits of this technology on other chains, specifically Base. As a more trader focused platform, we have created a **filtered new pairs watcher** for all the protocols on the Base chain, including ApeStore, BaseJumpPro, Holdfun and more.&#x20;

With the feel of Photon and Bullx, but the degenerateness of pumpfun clones, we aim to protect the competitive market while allowing Base to still have the opportunity to have Solana degen traders rotate over when the time comes.
