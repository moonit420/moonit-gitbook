# Dev-Incentivized Token Launches

## Problem

On Base, the largest issue are the rugs that happen from a team bundle and the malicious Solidity proxy contracts. While existing pumpfun clones on Base suffice as a solution, we aim to promote our own technical solution that our researching team has studied for months.

The primary issue is that token launchers won't necessarily want to use fair launch platforms as they lose out on their value prop of profit. After all, individuals rug because they want money.&#x20;

Being limited to only selling out and bundling is the ecosystem Solana promotes, but to appease both money hungry devs and a safer trading environment, we present our own bonding curve launching platform.

## Solution

The primary solution is that we present a token launching system that allows devs to set a tax fee (EVM native) to both fend off EVM snipers and also allow them to capture more of their share of tokens.

Devs can also specify whether or not they want to include an airdrop, a reserve for KOL onboarding, or their own tax wallets. This creates an ecosystem that has the best of both worlds: devs are incentivized to launch while traders no longer have to worry about proxy contracts.

Some other features that may be integrated in the future to expand the dev's options in launching are...

* Anti Rug Curve - Fully linear y=x
* Slower Price Appreciation - Exponential y=x^2
* Mystery Bonding Curve - Fills at X $ETH
